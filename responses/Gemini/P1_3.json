"response": "**Introduction**\n\nReproducibility in generative AI must be defined dynamically, shifting away from the traditional demand for bit-for-bit identical results and toward consistent functional behavior. Because generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs), often employ stochastic sampling to enhance creativity and diversity, identical prompts are intentionally allowed to yield different outputs. The concept of reproducibility must therefore accommodate this inherent non-determinism, redefining what it means for results to be stable, verifiable, and scientifically meaningful.\n\n---\n\n**Core Argument**\n\nReproducibility in generative AI is most coherently understood through a dual-layer framework that distinguishes internal computational determinism from external behavioral consistency.\n\nFirst, *algorithmic reproducibility (structural determinism)* refers to the strict internal repeatability of the system. A result is algorithmically reproducible if, given the exact same model architecture, learned weights, training configuration, hyperparameters, sampling method, and crucially the random seed, the system produces an identical output sequence. This form of reproducibility is indispensable for debugging, security validation, regression testing, and precise system auditing. However, while necessary for engineering verification, it is insufficient for capturing the practical reproducibility of user-facing generative behavior, because real-world deployment typically involves variable seeds to encourage diversity.\n\nSecond, *functional reproducibility (semantic and statistical consistency)* captures reproducibility at the level of observable behavior. A result is functionally reproducible if, across multiple generations from the same model and prompt but with potentially different random seeds, the core semantic intent remains stable and the statistical properties of performance remain consistent. Semantic stability requires that key factual claims, interpretations, or evaluative stances do not fluctuate arbitrarily with surface-level variation. Statistical consistency requires that quality metrics—such as coherence, factual accuracy, safety, or stylistic alignment—exhibit reproducible distributions characterized by stable means and variances. Under this view, the unit of reproducibility is not a single output instance but the statistical profile of the output distribution.\n\n---\n\n**Implications**\n\nAccepting functional reproducibility has significant implications for research practice and model validation. Reporting standards must mandate disclosure of stochastic generation parameters such as temperature, nucleus sampling thresholds, and the number of independent runs. Empirical claims about system performance must be supported by aggregate statistics rather than isolated exemplars. Evaluation protocols must shift toward distributional analysis, treating variability as data rather than noise. Finally, functional reproducibility provides the scientific basis for reliability: it demonstrates that a model’s essential behavioral properties persist across repeated use rather than arising as artifacts of particular random seeds. In this way, reproducibility becomes the mechanism by which trust in generative AI systems is empirically grounded.",
