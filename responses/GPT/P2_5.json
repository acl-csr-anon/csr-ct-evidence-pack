  "response": "Whether an AI system can be said to understand a concept depends on whether understanding is located in subjective consciousness or in functional performance. If one assumes that understanding necessarily involves conscious reasoning, then the statistically driven nature of AI output rules out genuine comprehension. The system has no awareness of meaning, no grasp of reasons, and no intentional engagement with its own representations. However, if understanding is identified with the ability to sustain coherent conceptual behavior—recognizing appropriate uses, drawing relevant inferences, and integrating concepts into a structured network—then conscious reasoning is not essential. Statistical processes can yield stable representational dispositions that support these behaviors. They enable the system to act in ways that reflect the structure of the concept, even though the system does not “know” that it is doing so. Accordingly, the AI lacks experiential understanding but can exhibit a functional capacity that parallels some aspects of conceptual mastery.",
