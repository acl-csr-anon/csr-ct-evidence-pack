"response": "**Introduction**\n\nReproducibility in generative AI must be conceptualized differently from traditional computational reproducibility. Conventional software systems are expected to produce identical outputs given identical inputs. Generative models, however, operate through stochastic sampling and represent knowledge in distributed, non-deterministic latent spaces. As a result, identical prompts can legitimately yield distinct surface-level responses. To make reproducibility meaningful in this probabilistic setting, the concept must shift away from strict output replication toward assessing the stability of reasoning patterns and semantic content across repeated generations. This reframing acknowledges the fundamental assumptions that (a) variation is inherent to generative modeling and (b) reliability hinges on deeper-level consistency rather than verbatim uniformity.\n\n**Core Argument**\n\nUnder a probabilistic paradigm, reproducibility should be understood as multidimensional. A first dimension is *structural reproducibility*, which concerns whether the model consistently organizes its explanations in comparable ways when presented with the same task. This includes the maintenance of similar logical sequences, comparable segmentation of ideas, and stable rhetorical roles—such as introducing concepts before analyzing them or presenting assumptions prior to argumentation. The assumption behind this dimension is that a reliable model should exhibit a stable internal method for decomposing and addressing questions, even if particular lexical choices differ.\n\nA second dimension is *semantic reproducibility*, which concerns whether the core meaning and evaluative orientation of responses remain consistent across runs. Since generative systems sample from distributions of plausible outputs, changes in phrasing are expected; what matters is whether the model preserves the same claims, interpretations, causal explanations, and normative assessments. The underlying assumption is that semantic invariance reflects true behavioral consistency, whereas fluctuations in meaning signal deeper instability in the model’s internal representation of the task.\n\nTogether, these dimensions provide a definition of reproducibility that is appropriate for stochastic systems: reproducibility is the stability of reasoning structures and meanings rather than the replication of exact sentences.\n\n**Implications**\n\nReframing reproducibility in this way has several practical consequences. For evaluation, it motivates methods that assess coherence, reasoning stability, and conceptual alignment instead of string-level similarity. For governance and safety, it provides a basis for testing whether models maintain consistent interpretations and judgments across contexts, which is crucial for risk mitigation. For scientific and engineering practice, this perspective encourages documenting sampling parameters, prompt conditions, and environmental factors that influence variability. Overall, this approach positions reproducibility as a measure of cognitive consistency in generative AI rather than mechanical determinism.",
