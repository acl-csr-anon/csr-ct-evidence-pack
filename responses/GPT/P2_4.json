  "response": "The notion of understanding can be approached from two philosophical angles: experiential and functional. The experiential view insists that understanding involves conscious engagement with meaning, a sense of grasping or comprehending. Under this definition, an AI system that operates through the statistical transformation of inputs cannot be said to understand, because it lacks the subjective dimension required for genuine comprehension. However, the functional view interprets understanding in terms of patterned responsiveness: the ability to use a concept correctly, infer its implications, and integrate it with a larger conceptual scheme. On this account, understanding does not depend on consciousness but on reliable and structured behavior. Statistical generation can provide precisely the sort of regularity required to sustain these functions. The stability of conceptual relations, not the mechanism by which outputs are formed, becomes the central criterion. Therefore, while an AI system falls short of understanding as a phenomenological event, it may nonetheless instantiate operational understanding through its ability to model and manipulate semantic structure.",
