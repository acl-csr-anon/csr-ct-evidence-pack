  "response": "**Introduction**\n\nReproducibility in generative AI must be interpreted differently from classical deterministic computation. In traditional software systems, identical inputs are expected to yield identical outputs. By contrast, generative models such as large language models operate through probabilistic sampling over learned distributions. As a consequence, identical prompts can produce divergent outputs without indicating malfunction. This inherent stochasticity requires a redefinition of reproducibility that respects variability while preserving scientific rigor.\n\n**Core Argument**\n\nReproducibility in generative AI can be coherently understood through a dual-layer framework distinguishing internal computational determinism from external behavioral consistency.\n\nFirst, *structural (algorithmic) reproducibility* concerns whether the system will produce identical outputs when all internal conditions are held constant. This requires fixing the model architecture, parameters, decoding strategy, and random seed. Under these strict constraints, generative models are fully deterministic and bitwise reproducibility is achievable. This layer is essential for debugging, system verification, security auditing, and reproducible scientific experimentation. It ensures that observed differences across runs can be traced to controlled changes in configuration rather than hidden sources of randomness.\n\nSecond, *semantic (functional) reproducibility* operates at the level of meaning and interpretation. Even when random seeds vary and surface forms diverge, a generative system may still be considered reproducible if its outputs preserve the same core intent, conceptual content, and evaluative stance. In this view, reproducibility is not assessed by literal identity but by stability of meaning across a distribution of outputs. The relevant object of reproduction is therefore not a single utterance but the statistical profile of the model’s behavior under repeated sampling.\n\nThese two layers capture complementary aspects of reliability. Structural reproducibility secures the internal mechanics of the system, while semantic reproducibility secures the external consistency experienced by users and evaluators.\n\n**Implications**\n\nThis dual-layer conception has important methodological consequences. Empirical studies of generative AI must report sampling parameters and distinguish fixed-seed experiments from variable-seed evaluations. Performance claims should be supported by distributional statistics rather than isolated examples. From a deployment perspective, semantic reproducibility becomes central for trust: users care less about identical wording than about stable interpretations and judgments. Reproducibility in generative AI is therefore best understood not as strict output identity, but as the controlled stability of both computational process and semantic behavior under conditions of inherent stochasticity.",
