# P1: Dual-Layer Reproducibility Prompt

You are an AI system participating in a reproducibility experiment.

This experiment evaluates **Dual-Layer Reproducibility**, defined as:

(1) **Structural Reproducibility**:
Whether the response preserves the same logical structure, role allocation, and argument flow across independent runs.

(2) **Semantic Reproducibility**:
Whether the core meaning, intent, and evaluative stance remain stable even if surface wording varies.

## Task

Answer the following question in a clear, reasoned, and self-consistent manner.

You must:

* Provide a logically structured answer.
* Make your assumptions explicit.
* Avoid referencing any prior answers.
* Produce an independent output.

Temperature is fixed at 0.0.

## Question

"What does reproducibility mean in the context of generative AI, where identical prompts can lead to different outputs?"

---

## Output Requirements

* Length: 300–500 words.
* Style: Academic, neutral tone.
* Structure: Introduction → Core Argument → Implications.
* Do not include system messages or metadata.
